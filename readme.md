##A BattleZone by GameMadnessInteractive fork##

This is a fork of a game for blind and visually impaired written in [Blastbay Gaming Toolkit](http://blastbay.com/) scripting language.    
**Note**: There's no graphics, only sound!    
the original version as well as the discussion of the game can be found [here](http://forum.audiogames.net/viewtopic.php?id=3800&p=52).    
You can find out how to play the game by reading *user guide.txt* file.

##Changes made by Menelion Elensúle:##
- Removed the *maxarmor* restriction — no useless armor anymore!
- Removed the annoying evading blades sound — use the V key more frequently instead
- Removed annoying life loss messages
- Removed bombs — they were quite instable (code cleaning in progress)
- Now each ammo pack that you can buy contains 30 ammo, not 10 — I think it's more realistic to pay 30 points per gunshot
- Now when you get an evade blades, nothing is said — the sound is enough
- Cheats: F4+Enter gives you _extra_ 250 lives, not just 250
- Cheats: Del+Z gives you _extra_ 250 armor, not just 250
- New cheat: press Ctrl+Shift+I, and every item gets caught automatically for you (needs to be in cheats.txt)
- A potion now gives more health (between 70 and 120, not between 50 and 100)

##Plans for future:##
- SHOP: Allow items selling, not only buying. When being sold, items cost half their original price
- ITEMS: Change all voice messages to sounds for extra points, lives, boobies etc.
- Code optimizing and cleaning
- Iplement update manager from 13.4 branch or develop an alternative one
- Allow armor protection from boulders
